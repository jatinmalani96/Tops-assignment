oop and pop difference between

--> this program divided into object                      --> this program divide into function
--> bottom up approach                                    --> top down approach
--> data in each object controlled on                     --> Every function has different data, so thereâ€™s no control
    it own                                                     over it
--> object function are linked through                     --> part of programming are linked through parameter passing
    massage passing
--> adding new data and fuction easy                       --> expanding data and function is not easy
-->Inheritance is supported in three                       --> Inheritance not support
   modes : privet, public,protected
--> Data can be hidden using Encapsulation                 --> no data hiding data is accessible globally
--> overloading function constructors and                   --> overloading are not possible
    operators are done
--> Used for solving big problems                           --> Not suitable for solving big problems
